# alexa-iot
Welcome to my Alexa IOT project. This project started as a class project for a certificate program I'm taking in IOT design. This project will guide you through creating a simple IOT concept using the Raspberry Pi 3. You'll use the RPi3 and the Pie SenseHat send temperature, humidity, and pressure values into AWS to be accessed by an Alexa skill. 

# what you'll need
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Pie SenseHat
