# alexa-iot
Welcome to my Alexa IOT project. This project started as a class project for a certificate program I'm taking in IOT design. I hope this will help others trying to learn how to build IOT devices and integrate with Alexa. This project will guide you through creating a simple IOT prototype using the Raspberry Pi 3. The project contains:

1. The Raspberry Pi 3. 
2. A Pie SenseHat with temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors as well as an LED display.
3. An example Alexa Skill called 'PieControls.'
4. An AWS Lambda function called by the Alexa Skill to process the voice requests.
5. An AWS IOT Thing and Thing Shadow.
6. An AWS dynamoDB.
7. (Optionally) the Alexa Voice Service sample project. 

# what you'll need
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Pie SenseHat
- AWS Free Tier Account
- Alexa Skills Kit Account
- (Optional) USB Mic.
- (Optional) External Speaker.
