# alexa-iot
Welcome to my Alexa IOT project. This started as a class project for a certificate program I'm taking in IOT design. My final project to date is a mini-weather station using a Raspberry Pi 3 with the Pi SenseHat. I’ve also Alexa-enabled my Raspberry Pi using the Alexa Voice Service sample project and I’ve connected the Pi to AWS IOT enabling me to create an Alexa Voice Skill to access the sensor data and even write messages to the LED display on the Pi SenseHat. 

I’m documenting this from a beginner perspective and I hope this will help others trying to learn how to build IOT devices and integrate with Alexa. This project will guide you through creating a simple IOT prototype using the Raspberry Pi 3.
